# Schemus

A "toy" intepreter for the Scheme programming language aiming to be compliant with the R7RS-small standard.

> The project is in a very early stage of development, so beware and come back later for solid features and decent R7RS compliance: the project has been prematurely made public simply because [a certain guy](https://github.com/dunklecat) was a bit impatient :)
